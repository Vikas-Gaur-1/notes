## 1. Basic Concept and Purpose

QKD is a groundbreaking secure communication method that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Its primary functions include:

* Generating a shared secret key between two parties (conventionally named Alice and Bob)
* Enabling secure encryption and decryption of messages
* Providing the ability to detect any eavesdropping attempts through quantum mechanical principles

## 2. Fundamental Quantum Mechanics Principles

### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
* Establishes that measuring a quantum state inevitably disturbs it
* Makes it impossible to simultaneously measure certain pairs of properties with perfect accuracy

### No-cloning Theorem
* States that creating a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state is impossible
* Provides fundamental protection against eavesdroppers attempting to copy quantum information

## 3. BB84 Protocol

### Quantum State Preparation (Alice)
* Utilizes single photons with four distinct polarization orientations:
  * Vertical (0°)
  * Horizontal (90°)
  * Diagonal (+45°)
  * Anti-diagonal (-45°)
* These orientations serve to represent binary 0s and 1s

### Basis Choice
* Employs two measurement bases:
  * Rectilinear basis (vertical/horizontal)
  * Diagonal basis (+45°/-45°)
* Alice randomly selects a basis for each photon

### Transmission Process
* Alice transmits polarized photons to Bob
* Bob randomly selects measurement basis for each photon
* Basis matching occurs probabilistically

### Measurement (Bob)
* Matching bases: Yields correct bit value
* Non-matching bases: Produces random result

### Classical Communication
* Public discussion of used bases
* Retention of matching-basis bits only
* Formation of the "sifted key"

## 4. Security Features

### Eavesdropping Detection
* Eavesdropper (Eve) must guess measurement basis
* Incorrect basis choice disturbs quantum state
* Results in detectable errors in the key

### Error Rate Analysis
* Normal channel: ~1-2% error rate
* Compromised channel: Elevated error rate
* Threshold breach triggers protocol abort and restart

## 5. Key Processing Steps

### Error Correction
* Implements detection and correction of shared key errors
* Utilizes classical error correction algorithms
* Requires public discussion

### Privacy Amplification
* Reduces potential information leakage to eavesdroppers
* Produces shorter but more secure final key
* Employs hash functions

## 6. Practical Implementation Challenges

### Hardware Limitations
* Difficulties in single-photon source creation
* Detector efficiency concerns
* Environmental interference issues

### Distance Limitations
* Photon loss in optical fiber transmission
* Current range limit: ~100-200 km without quantum repeaters
* Ongoing development of quantum repeaters

## 7. Advanced QKD Protocols

### E91 Protocol
* Based on entangled photon pairs
* Implements Bell's inequality
* Provides enhanced security compared to BB84

### Continuous-variable QKD
* Utilizes continuous quantum states
* Better compatibility with existing telecom infrastructure

## 8. Real-World Applications
