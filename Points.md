# Quantum Mechanics Foundations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

## 1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
### Core Concept
- Fundamental quantum mechanics principle stating that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously measured with absolute precision
- In a quantum system, only one property of conjugate properties (like position and momentum) can be known with certainty

### Implications for QKD
- Measurement inherently disturbs the quantum system
- Photon polarization used as a key mechanism for secure communication
- Any unauthorized measurement will introduce detectable changes in the quantum state

## 2. No Cloning Theorem
### Core Concept
- It is fundamentally impossible to create perfect, identical copies of an unknown quantum state
- Prevents unauthorized duplication of quantum information

### Security Implications
- Provides a natural mechanism for detecting eavesdropping
- Any attempt to intercept or copy quantum information will introduce detectable anomalies
- Ensures the integrity of quantum communication channels

## 3. Quantum Entanglement
### Core Concept
- Quantum particles can become entangled, sharing correlated states regardless of physical distance
- Measurement of one particle instantaneously affects its entangled partner

### Applications in Quantum Communication
- Basis for advanced quantum communication protocols
- Enables quantum teleportation through classical information channels
- Fundamental to protocols like Eckert's protocol for secure key distribution
