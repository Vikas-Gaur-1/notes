### Saving Your Notes

1. Open a text editor (e.g., **Sublime Text** or **VS Code**).
2. Create a new file and save it with the `.md` extension, such as `my_notes.md`.
3. Use the above Markdown syntax to structure your notes.
4. Save the file.

Once you've created and saved your notes in `.md` format, you can use a Markdown viewer or an editor like **VS Code** or **Typora** to see the rendered version of your notes.

If you're storing your notes on GitHub or OneDrive, you can simply upload the `.md` file to sync and access it across devices.


### Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

```


### Explanation:
1. The code block starts with three backticks (`) followed by the language identifier (`python` in this case).
2. The code block ends with three backticks (`) placed **on a new line** without any extra spaces or indentation.
3. Any text after the closing backticks will no longer be treated as part of the code block.
